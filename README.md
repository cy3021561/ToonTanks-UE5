## Overview

Toon Tank is an exciting course project developed for the Udemy course "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games." The project aims to teach participants how to create a fun and engaging tank game using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) and C++ programming. By building various gameplay mechanics and features, Toon Tank provides an interactive and educational experience for aspiring game developers.

## Project Plan

1. **Create a Tank that Can Move Throughout the World:** Toon Tank starts by implementing a player-controlled tank that can navigate the game world using WASD movement. Participants will learn to handle user input and control the tank's movement.

2. **Handle Input (WASD Movement, Mouse Click):** The course covers the process of handling input from the player, enabling the tank to respond to keyboard input for movement and mouse clicks for other actions.

3. **Create an Enemy Turret Class:** Participants will learn to create an enemy turret class, which adds an exciting element of challenge to the game. These enemy turrets will be capable of tracking and firing at the player's tank.

4. **Add Fire Functionality with Projectiles:** The project introduces projectile firing mechanics, allowing the player's tank and enemy turrets to shoot projectiles at each other.

5. **Add Health, Damage, and Destruction to the Game:** Students will implement health and damage systems for both the player's tank and enemy turrets. Upon reaching zero health, entities will be destroyed with visual effects.

6. **Add Special Effects (Smoke, Explosions, Sounds):** To enhance the game's visual and auditory experience, participants will learn to add special effects, including smoke and explosions, accompanied by appropriate sound effects.

7. **Add Winning/Losing Conditions with HUD Displays:** The course concludes with implementing winning and losing conditions. Players will receive visual feedback through HUD displays, indicating the outcome of the game.

## What I Learned

Through the development of Toon Tank, participants will gain practical experience and knowledge in the following areas:

1. **C++ Gameplay Programming:** Students will learn how to program gameplay mechanics, enabling interactivity and control in the game world.

2. **User Input Handling:** The course will cover the handling of user input to create responsive and dynamic gameplay.

3. **Enemy AI Development:** Participants will explore the basics of enemy AI development and implement enemy behaviors.

4. **Projectile Mechanics:** Students will learn to create projectiles and implement firing mechanics for a tank-based game.

5. **Health and Damage Systems:** The course will teach participants how to design and implement health and damage systems for game entities.

6. **Special Effects and Sound Integration:** Participants will enhance the game experience by adding special effects and sound integration.

7. **Winning and Losing Conditions:** Students will learn to create win and lose conditions and provide feedback through HUD displays.
